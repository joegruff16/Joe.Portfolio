# Joe's Portfolio
=================

## Description

I developed my own portolio website that has a responsive nav bar with social media buttons, a custom google font and a display of my porfolio of projects. I only have two projects so far so I used some place holder images. Since I was born in Philadelphia, I made my portfolio a Philly theme. When you click each image it takes you to my project or the image placeholder. 

## Finished Product 

This is my completed Portfolio Project. I will continue to make updates as I grow in my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
